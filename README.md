# un_necessary-education
The final project at the TeachMeSkills IT school. As children, we were often asked: "Who will you be when you grow up?", we answered that we wanted to become astronauts, policemen or super-models. Oh, this is childhood. As adults, we remember, with tears on our cheeks, about long-standing dreams, sitting in a trolleybus, returning after an 8-hour working day. The project I developed is a website that will serve as an author's column in a local newspaper. The column tells about people who have found the strength to find their favorite activity in life, because as we know it is not so easy. I hope that this little column, which has a soul, will help many people find faith in themselves and make life successful.
